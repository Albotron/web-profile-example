                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Phil Albonetti. This is my 18th year teaching and my 11th at Fishers. My wife, Anya, and I have three children: Luke (10 years), Nadia (8 years), and Coletta (5 years). I came to Fishers by way of the Tindley Accelerated Schools, where I worked for six years. I earned my undergraduate degree at Vanderbilt University, where I was a computer science major for a time but switched to English literature. I went on to earn an masters degree in literature at Notre Dame. The past couple of years I picked up my studies on computer science by taking classes at Ivy Tech and Indiana University.</p>

                <p>The assignment calls for you students to post a picture just of yourself. I'm sure they do that for privacy reasons. Well, the deal is that I do what I want and I want to post photos of my family. So, by golly, I'm gonna do that.</p>

                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p>In this section, students should post at least two assignments from this class. According to the directions, this section should include Titles, Images, Links, and Descriptions. Read the assigment instructions for what you should post, but you can also follow my lead. I plan to put the assignments in two columns of a Bootstrap row.</p>

                <a href="CreditCardProgram.java">Credit Card Number Checker - Java Program</a>
                <p>This program determines if a credit card is a valid number or not. First it takes in the user's card number and conducts input validation checks: A. is the number is the correct length (13-16 digits) and B. is the input actually a number and not other character types (letters, punctuation, etc.)? Next the program conducts a Luhn check on the credit card number. Step 1: Double every second digit starting at the left of the number. If the doubling creates a two digit number then add those two digits to create a new single digit number. Step 2: Add all the single digit numbers from Step 1. Step 3: Add all the digits from the odd places of the number together. Step 4: Add the even digit total from Step 2 and the odd digit total from Step 3. Step 5: Calculate if the number from Step 4 is divisible by 10 (number % 10 == 0). If yes, then the credit card number is valid. If not, then it is an invalid number.</p>

                <p>This project requires less explanation than the previous one. I used my camera drone to take a photo of the sunset in our back property. Then I paid a company to turn that photo into a puzzle for my wife for her birthday. Your website will probably need to focus more on academic stuff, but I thought this photo and story would lighten things up on this sample website.</p>
